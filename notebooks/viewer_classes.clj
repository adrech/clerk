;; To support customizing the result css class, we can't really use
;; `:render-opts` because its opts don't apply to the result but to
;; the wrapping `result-viewer`. Should we thus stick to
;; `::clerk/css-class` for this?

;; To make things work consistently, we'd then want to support
;; `::clerk/css-class` on the ns meta again to change it doc-wide.

;; We should rename `::clerk/opts` to `::clerk/render-opts` which
;; communicates the intent much better.
